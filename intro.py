    st.write(" The aim of this project is to build a web based platform that helps to ease the data exploration and preprocessing steps and provide a smart and automated technique for exploratory analysis of the data. We also aim to predict possible values from the dataset by using various machine learning models and display it using different data visualization techniques.")

    st.write("## About the project")
    st.write("A lot of times, getting a high level analysis takes time to code and develop, and generally follows a linear path. This project was designed to streamline that process and eventually build a baseline machine learning model as a citizen data scientist. The fun part of this project is that it provides some toy datasets to get a feel of the platform.You can also upload your own datasets to get some insights from.")
